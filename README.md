## Tasks

There are some failing tests. Try to fix them all.

1. Scopes: Modify the `User.by_email` scope to allow wildcard search.
2. Data: Complete the method `Thank.stats_messages_sent` which should return all sent messages grouped by an entity.
3. API: Post a message to another user. (User authentication is simplified.)
